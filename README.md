# FIN5016 Assignment 2: Robo-Advising & Algorithmic Trading

This repository contains the completed tasks for FIN5016 – Assessment 2 at La Trobe University. The assessment explores the development of financial applications in Python using **robo-advising** and **algorithmic trading** concepts. The focus is on practical implementation and performance evaluation using real-world data.

## 📁 Repository Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `FIN5016_Assessment_2_Task_1.ipynb` | Implementation of a Robo-Advisor using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to recommend optimal portfolios based on client risk profiles and efficient frontier visualization. |
| `FIN5016_Assessment_2_Task_2.ipynb` | Development and backtesting of an algorithmic trading strategy (e.g., Moving Average Crossover), with performance evaluation using metrics such as Sharpe Ratio. |

## 🧠 Task Summaries

### 📊 Task 1: Robo-Advising
- Load and clean historical stock data from the past 2 years.
- Apply Modern Portfolio Theory to compute portfolio returns, volatility, and Sharpe Ratios.
- Plot the **Efficient Frontier**.
- Recommend optimal portfolios based on client risk tolerance (conservative, moderate, aggressive).

### 📈 Task 2: Algorithmic Trading Strategy
- Build and implement a trading strategy (e.g., Moving Average Crossover).
- Backtest the strategy on historical price data.
- Evaluate the performance using real-world financial metrics such as:
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Maximum Drawdown
  - Cumulative Returns

---

## 💻 Tools Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance`
- Performance metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Drawdown

---

## 📌 Notes
- All code is written to be **error-free**, well-commented in Markdown, and reproducible.
- The focus is on clarity, performance evaluation, and real-world relevance in FinTech.
