# FIN5016 Assignment 2: Robo-Advising and Algorithmic Trading

## Project Overview

This project consists of two practical FinTech applications developed using Python:  
1. A **robo-advisory model** that uses Modern Portfolio Theory to recommend investment portfolios based on a client's risk profile.  
2. An **algorithmic trading strategy**, implemented and backtested on historical data, with performance metrics used to evaluate real-world viability.
